Finn and Jake need your help on their next quest.  Their quest is to create an Interactive Page for Adventure Time!  They have already gathered the necessary images to start you off.  It's up to you to put it the site together or else the Ice King will freeze you!!!!!!!

Work in teams of 2 (Just like Finn and Jake)


Along the way, they may interact with the other main characters of the show: Princess Bubblegum, the Ice King, and Marceline the Vampire Queen.


Requirements:

1) Style till your heart is content (background-color, position, divs, navbars, footers, etc.)

2) Be interactive using JQuery or Javascript events (DOM manipulation using jquery, click, show, hide, etc.)

3) Proper tabbing on your code

4) Must have fun!!


You will be presenting at the end of the day!
You will have 2 modules to work on this.



PS. Jake really likes jquery and css animations ;)

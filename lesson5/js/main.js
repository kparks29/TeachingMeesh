//code goes here



//Declare a variable called diff and set it to firstNum minus secondNum
//code goes here



//Declare a variable called product and set it to firstNum times secondNum
//code goes here



//Declare a variable called quotient and set it to firstNum divided by secondNum
//code goes here




/*=======================
        Part 4
=======================*/
//There are built in functions for variables

//Declare a variable called myLength and set it to the length of myName;

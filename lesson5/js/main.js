/*=======================
        Part 1
=======================*/
//Let's learn about variables

//Declare a variable called myName
//code goes here
var myName;



//Next set myName to Meesh
//code goes here
myName = "Meesh";


/*=======================
        Part 2
=======================*/
//There are different types of variables

//Declare variables called firstNum and set it to 2 and secondNum and set it to 5
//code goes here
var firstNum = 2;
var secondNum = 5;



/*=======================
        Part 3
=======================*/
//You can do math to variables

//Declare a variable sum and set it to firstNum plus secondNum
//code goes here
var sum = firstNum + secondNum;


//Declare a variable diff and set it to firstNum minus secondNum
//code goes here
var diff = firstNum - secondNum;


//Declare a variable product and set it to firstNum times secondNum
//code goes here
var product = firstNum * secondNum;


//Declare a variable called quotient and set it to firstNum divided by secondNum
//code goes here
var quotient = firstNum / secondNum;



/*=======================
        Part 4
=======================*/
//There are built in functions for variables

//Declare a variable called myLength and set it to the length of name;
//code goes here
var myLength = myName.length;


//Declare a variable called upcaseName and make it to equal to myName but with all uppercase letters
//code goes here
var upcaseName = myName.toUpperCase();
